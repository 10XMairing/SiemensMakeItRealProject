### TEAM SOURAV439_6718

Our application, “AgTech” which is a mobile and web based platform       has been designed to manage the needs of the farmers during       production as well as distribution. It’s core belief is to use the       per-existing resources in the agricultural sector and build upon them    to improve their allocation to the farmers thereby increasing       productivity.
